# Baldurs-Gate-Install-Order-List-Repository
This Respository is a collection of user submitted WeiDU logs for Baldurs Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET). The aim of this collection is to assist players in determining install orders and compatability by being able to see other user uploaded WeiDU logs.  

**DISCLAIMER** If you choose to use these logs, it is your responsibility to determine if the install orders are current and work without conflict. 

## Request to Add Your WeiDU Log
To request to submit your WeiDU log(s), please create a push request. You will need to create a unique folder in the [User Submitted WeiDU Logs](https://github.com/morpheus562/Baldurs-Gate-Install-Order-List-Repository/tree/main/user-submitted-weidu-logs) that will be named after your username (i.e. morpheus562). In your unique folder place your WeiDU logs with the following nomenclature: "WeiDU-<game (i.e. BGEE, BG2EE, EET)>-DDMMYYYY.log" where DDMMYYYY is the day, month, and year the install was completed. Examples include: WeiDU-BGEE-01052022.log and WeiDU-EET-01052022.log.
