## Graion Dilach's install orders:

Generally speaking my install orders are mostly content mods which have EET compatibility, work without the BP-BGT Worldmap and do not enforce NPCs onto the player to get through them (with areally few exceptions).

My specific preferences which I might need to clarify on
 - Yes, I prefer SCS before EET\_End and I prefer ATweaks before SCS. Due to ATweaks being old, I have a better trust in SCS adapting to it than vice versa. Also, the Kahrk update of SCS 34 makes me vary, since NPC (mods) might want to interject into that longterm which needs to be before EET\_End. I am not using the components where SCS and ATweaks would explicitly overlap.
 - Tweaks Anthology's mage/sorcerer tables tweaks are split and moved before Tome & Blood, according to the latter's readme which states these are required for multiclass sorcerers. This can be easily overlooked.
 - ATweaks Paladin buffs partially overlap with IWDfication's and Made in Heaven's paladin buffs and result with duplicated innate abilities. YMMV (I should review this).
 - Made in Heaven Spell XP tweaks gives out more XP than EET_Tweaks' respectable option but one overwrites the other which is why MIH_SP is split.
 - Lesser known/used creature-tweak encounter mods (Made in Heaven/D0QuestPack) are moved after NPCs, to ensure they can pick up the additional monsters involved in NPC mods' personal quests. I'm not sure if there actually are such, but I prefer standardization in this case.
 - Some of the NPC\_EE components are moved above class tweak mods, to ensure classtweak mod which go over all creatures and filter for their respective classes pick up these NPCs changing classes.

The 2021-12-23 install order has one issue with EEEE's wyvern component where I actually made a mistake and will need to update my mod to ensure the wyverns are sapwned. There are also some overlaps in some spells (DSotSC vs IWD) but otherwise it should be fine for a playthrough (although you might want to check for mod updates compared against it).
