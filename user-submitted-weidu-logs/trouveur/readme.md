## Trouveur install orders:

This mod install is focused on a shorty party with Skitia's Kale, Helga and Recorder, Artisan's Aura, and Yeslick and Lava's Dvaradime for the BG2 part. I use Deities of Faerun cleric kits for cleric NPC and Bardic Wonders Keippelmeister for Recorder. I add many quests mods and use XP reduction : no xp for traps and scrolls scribing, 50% xp for killing and 75% xp for quests.
