## Ensrick install orders:

As provided on the discord channel, the following are caveats with the install order:
- I had to make the same manual changes that @lightbringer made for the mods we have in common
- TDDz obviously needs TDD folder in BG2 directory, but Spwi975 was deleted from spells
- I followed the SCS hotfix directions And I did have to make that language correction for BG2 UB to get the english path to stop throwing warnings it needs /ub/ in the english path in the setup.tp2 file
