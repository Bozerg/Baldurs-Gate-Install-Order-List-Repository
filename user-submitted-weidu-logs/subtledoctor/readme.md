### BG2EE WeiDU Log

My BG2EE weidu.log involves a bunch of NPCs, a number of smallish area/quest mods (all of Lava's stuff, but notably not TDD), a metric ton of new kits, and a boatload of rule tweaks to fine-tune things just so. I like SCS AI but do not install most of the Tactics-inspired revised encounters. I want the player-facing tweaks and the enemy characteristics/AI to interact so as to make most fights fluid and interesting - with some challenge and real risk, while not being near-impossible boxes to be unlocked but just the right key. There is not much in the way of UI mods, and no EEex, because I played this game on an iPad. 

Notes:
- Looking at this now, I am realizing how long ago I made this install. A number of mods, especially my own, have received substantive updates since then.
- In particular, NPC_EE is now at v5 and is quite different.
- Also, the last couple components of "SD's Random Tweaks" plus the "Better Spell Visuals" have been replaced by the Magic Battles Revised mod.

### BGEE WeiDU Log

Here is the BGEE install I just made. I have only played this one to the Nashkel Mines - since I have successfully gotten EET working on my iPad, I am going to abandon this install and set up an EET game instead. "The Vanishing of Skie Silvershield" is in very much the wrong place, it was not handled by the Mac Weidu Launcher when I was installing things and I forgot to look for it. I assume it should rather go near BG1UP or BG1NPCProject, or thereabouts...
