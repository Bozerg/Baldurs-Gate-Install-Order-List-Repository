## morpheus562 install orders:

I personally prefer my mod setups that focus heavily on rule tweaks, added items/spells/kits, and increased challenges and difficulties while typically avoiding large quest packs and NPC mods. After years of playing, this is how I personally enjoy my game and setups. 

There is currently an install warning with Rogue Rebalancing due to Beamdog patch v2.6.6. The warning can be ignored as it prevents a single item from being added to the game. A bug has been identified between Made in Heavens - Encounters & Quests and Sword Coast Strategems creating immortal dread wolves to appear. I recommend hesitancy when pairing the two together.

As stated on the main readme, I use Bubb's EEex. If you choose to use my logs, you will need to launch your game using the new InfinityLoader.exe which will be located in your main game folder.
